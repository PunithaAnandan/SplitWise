### Punitha Anandan Individual Project

### Project Statement:

It's quite a hectic job to track your billing dates, monthly expenses and to keep that all in one place. 
we prefer to save it in a Excel sheet but anything happens to your computer, all your saved stuff will be lost. 

### Problem Solution:

SplitWise maintains monthly expenses and tracks the due dates, paid dates of credit Card bills, insurance bills, and any monthly expenses.
Also  SplitWise keeps all the important billing dates in one place, which is web based database maintained by SplitWise.
And will get back of per month expenses via Chart.
