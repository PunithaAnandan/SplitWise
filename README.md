###Project Elevator Pitch:

It's quite a hectic job to track your billing dates, monthly expenses and to keep that all in one place. 
we prefer to save it in a Excel sheet but anything happens to your computer, all your saved stuff will be lost. 

###Problem Solution:

SplitWise maintains monthly expenses and tracks the due dates, paid dates of credit Card bills, insurance bills, and any monthly expenses.
Also  SplitWise keeps all the important billing dates in one place, which is web based database maintained by SplitWise.
This project keep all your expense details and notify you prior of month due date via E-Mail, 
and get your paid status from you and save it in your database. If you wish to compare your expenses you will get via Chart.
